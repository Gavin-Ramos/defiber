# Overview
The icons intended to be used with this library are the Material icons provided by `@mui/icons-material`.
This icon set can be searched [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/).

The icons are not included in this bundle as a direct dependency to reduce bundle size and to support tree
shaking by the applications using this library. 

Projects intending to use this library with icons need to install `@mui/icons-material` as well as the
other peer dependencies listed by this library's `package.json` file.

## Icon component
This library includes a basic `Icon` component that supports styling MUI icons with this library's theme values.
This approach is recommended over including MUI components directly in your project so icons will look consistent across
ND's web products.

In order to specify which icon to use, the MUI component should be passed to the `icon` prop of the `Icon` component.

```tsx
import AccessAlarmIcon from '@mui/icons-material/AccessAlarm';

<Icon icon={AccessAlarmIcon} />
```

### Basic usage
<Canvas of={IconStories.Default} />

### Customizing color
<Canvas of={IconStories.CustomColor} />

## Button icons
Icons within buttons, or clickable icons that serve as buttons, should go through the `Button` component.
In this case, the icon component from MUI should be passed to the `primaryIcon`, `leftIcon`, or `rightIcon`
prop depending on whether the icon is the primary label for the button or if it is text to other button text.
