# Hesburgh Library Design System

The goals of this design system are:
- to establish a standard set of design values and patterns to be used across Hesburgh Library's web projects
- to deliver a set of reusable components to reduce developer work, improve the maintainability of our codebases,
and to ensure consistent functionality and UX across our projects
- to ensure all UI work done by Hesburgh Library is fully accessible to those with disabilities

## Theme
This design system uses a theme to tokenize the style values for the components included in this library.
This library also exposes these values for any additional downstream styling that may be needed.

Interally, this library uses [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), a React library that supports applying styles directly to React
components by referencing theme values. `Theme UI` uses the [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) library
internally to extract defined styles into CSS stylesheets and add them into the DOM.

With `Theme UI`, styles are added to native HTML elements (div, p, etc.) using the `sx` property.
The `sx` prop supports all the styles supported by React's vanilla `styles` props. It also supports
several "theme-aware" properties that will pull values from the theme. [See full documentation](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop).

The components included in this library all use `sx` prop that works identically to the Theme UI `sx` property
and will pass styles to the underlying native HTML elements.

### Color
The theme introduces a color palette of standardized colors. [See full palette.](/story/theme-colors--default)

### Typography
This component library assigns elements with appropriate text styles that will need minimal
customization and overrides. The typography assigned to each element is determined by the purpose
of the element in the document and its intended prominence.

That are three categories of typography that an element may fall under:

#### Heading
Heading typography is used for text elements that serve as landmarks that label for sections of the document.
[View heading styles.](/docs/elements-heading--docs).

#### Controls
Control typography is used for text elements that need to stand out as actionable, such as buttons, links, and form labels.
[View control styles.](/docs/elements-label--docs).

#### Paragraph
Paragraph typography is the default for text elements that neither actionable nor section headings.
